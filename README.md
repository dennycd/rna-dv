## RNA-DV | An Interactive Toolkit for RNA Design and Visualization

RNA-DV provides an interactive GUI for visualizing and designing RNA secondary structures. It allows users to interact directly with the RNA 2-d planar structure and modify it by altering primary sequence content and connect/disconnect nucleotide bonds. It  integrates thermodynamic energy calculations including 
* efn2
* HotKnots 
* Major
* RNAeval

It also recognizes a number of secondary structure formats including CT, RNAML and dot bracket (dp). For details, please look at the following papers

A user manual is here [GUIManual](https://github.com/dennycd/rna-dv/raw/master/doc/GUImanual.pdf). There is also a screencast demo
